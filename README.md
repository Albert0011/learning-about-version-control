# Learning about Version Control

Solving merge conflicts takes conscious effort, but I can do it!

What I like most about version control is that it allows the user to view or retrieve older snapshots of files and directories in a project.

The most challenging aspect of version control I find is dealing with merge conflicts. It can be frustrating when Git cannot automatically merge two versions of a file and help from a human is required. This can be especially difficult when working with more complex files such as Jupyter notebooks.
